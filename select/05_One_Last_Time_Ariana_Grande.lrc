[00:09.20] I was a liar
[00:10.68] I gave in to the fire
[00:12.59] I know I should've fought it
[00:14.50] At least I'm bein' honest
[00:16.90] Feel like a failure
[00:18.37] 'Cause I know that I failed you
[00:20.27] I should've done you better
[00:22.23] 'Cause you don't want a liar
[00:24.13] And I know
[00:24.65] And I know

[00:39.49] So one last time
[00:42.35] I need to be the one who takes you home
[00:47.40] One more time
[00:49.96] I promise after that 
[00:52.72] I'll let you go
[00:55.31] Baby, I don't care if you got her in your heart
[00:59.11] All I really care is you wake up in my arms
[01:02.77] One last time
[01:05.35] I need to be the one who takes you home
[01:10.62] I don't deserve it
[01:12.13] I know I don't deserve it
[01:14.07] But stay with me a minute
[01:15.97] I swear I'll make it worth it
[01:18.36] Can't you forgive me?
[01:19.79] At least just temporarily
[01:21.71] I know that this is my fault
[01:23.65] I should've been more careful
[01:25.55] And I know
[01:26.03] And I know
[01:26.55] And I know she gives you everything
